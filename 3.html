  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core
technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99%
of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.
Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code.
These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps.
The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms
to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional,
and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
